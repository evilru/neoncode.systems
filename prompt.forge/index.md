# \/\/prompt.forge

A living laboratory for testing [my prompt design method](/proto.labs/#my-method-for-prompt-design) through real-world use cases.

## The Experiment

For me, these prompts work exceptionally well. Through this experiment, I'm testing whether that's true for others too.

### How It Works

1. Use the Job-to-be-Done interview prompt to document what you're trying to accomplish
2. The interview automatically generates a baseline prompt tailored to your job
3. Submit your job via GitHub – I'll create a WSPL version for selected cases (~1 per week)
4. Test both, share what works better for you

See examples • Submit your job • Get your custom WSPL prompt

## Why Participate

For me, they work better. But don't take my word for it – try it yourself.

You get a custom prompt for selected use cases (I work on ~1 per week). I get real-world feedback on whether WSPL works for others.

This is open research. Your experience shapes the evolution of the method.
