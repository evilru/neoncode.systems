A living laboratory for testing WSPL through Job-to-be-Done prompts.

## The Experiment

What if we could compare two approaches to prompt writing side-by-side?  
That's exactly what we're doing here.

### How It Works

1. **Start with a Job-to-be-Done Interview**  
   Use our guided interview prompt with your AI (ChatGPT, Claude, or any major LLM) to document what you're trying to accomplish.
2. **Get Your Baseline Prompt**  
   The interview automatically generates a working prompt tailored to your job – this is your baseline version.
3. **Submit to GitHub**  
   Share your Job-to-be-Done documentation and baseline prompt via a GitHub issue.
4. **Community Votes** (if needed)  
   When multiple submissions come in, the community votes on which jobs to tackle first.
5. **WSPL Version Created**  
   I'll create an alternative version using WSPL methodology.
6. **Compare & Vote**  
   Test both prompts with your AI. Vote on which works better for you – subjectively, honestly.

## Why This Matters

This isn't about proving WSPL is "better" – it's about learning:

- Where does WSPL excel?  
- Where does it need refinement?  
- What patterns emerge from real-world usage?

You become part of the research process. Your feedback directly shapes the evolution of WSPL.

## Get Started

### Ready to Participate?

**→ [Get the Job-to-be-Done Interview Prompt](https://github.com/neoncode-systems/prompt-forge)**

Head to the GitHub repository to:

- Copy the interview prompt  
- See example submissions  
- Submit your own job  
- Vote on comparisons  

### What You'll Need

- Access to any major AI model (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- A task or workflow you want to create a prompt for
- 10-15 minutes for the interview
- Curiosity about what makes prompts work

## The Collection

All prompts created through this experiment will be collected in the repository – both baseline and WSPL versions. Think of it as a snapshot library of different prompt writing approaches applied to real problems.

**Note:** This is experimental research, not a maintained tool library. Prompts are optimized for learning, not long-term production use.

## Questions?

This is open, collaborative research. If something's unclear, open an issue on GitHub or reach out directly.

Let's explore what's possible with AI prompts – together.
