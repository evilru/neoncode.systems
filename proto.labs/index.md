Welcome to my experimental workshop – a space where ideas take shape, get tested, and evolve through practice.

## Current Experiments

### WSPL: My Method for Prompt Design

WSPL – my method for prompt design, developed through practice.

For me, they work exceptionally well. Through [//prompt.forge](/prompt.forge/), I'm testing whether that's true for others too.

See it in action. Join the experiment.

## Philosophy

This is not a portfolio of polished products – it's a laboratory.  
Experiments here are:

- **Transparent**: You see the process, not just results
- **Participatory**: Your input shapes the evolution
- **Iterative**: Nothing is "finished", everything learns

Think of this as open research. Snapshots of exploration, not production tools.

## Get Involved

Interested in experimenting together? Check out the active experiments above, explore the repositories, and join the conversation on GitHub.

Let's build, test, and learn together.
