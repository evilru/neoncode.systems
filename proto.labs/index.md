Welcome to my experimental workshop – a space where ideas take shape, get tested, and evolve through practice.

## Current Experiments

### WSPL: A New Approach to Prompt Writing

I'm developing and testing **WSPL** (Writing System for Prompt Language) – a methodology for crafting AI prompts that work differently than conventional approaches. Rather than explaining the theory, I'm proving it through practice.

**What makes it different?**  
Prompts written with WSPL are designed to be more resilient, adaptable, and effective across different AI models.

**How you can participate:**  
Head over to [//prompt.forge](/prompt.forge/) to see WSPL in action and join the experiment.

## Philosophy

This is not a portfolio of polished products – it's a laboratory.  
Experiments here are:

- **Transparent**: You see the process, not just results
- **Participatory**: Your input shapes the evolution
- **Iterative**: Nothing is "finished", everything learns

Think of this as open research. Snapshots of exploration, not production tools.

## Get Involved

Interested in experimenting together? Check out the active experiments above, explore the repositories, and join the conversation on GitHub.

Let's build, test, and learn together.
