You won't learn without trying. And you won't find out what's possible.

## Current Experiments

### My Method for Prompt Design

My method for prompt design, developed through practice.

For me, they work exceptionally well. I use only these prompts now – for all my work with AI. Through [//prompt.forge](/prompt.forge/), I'm testing whether that's true for others too.

The prompts below are built with this method. I'm sharing them so you can experiment and test for yourself. That's the experiment.

### Job To Be Done Prompt

Writing good prompts is hard. Most people don't realize how much unstated context affects the result. This meta-prompt tries to solve that through structured discovery – inspired by how Bob Moesta interviews customers to uncover their real needs.

### Learning Zone Mode Prompt

AI can make you lazy. Copy-paste solutions without understanding. This prompt tries to turn your AI into an adaptive teacher – one that keeps you learning instead of atrophying. Inspired by constructionist learning theory: you build understanding, not just collect answers.

## Philosophy

This is not a portfolio of polished products – it's a laboratory.  
Experiments here are:

- **Transparent**: You see the process, not just results
- **Participatory**: Your input shapes the evolution
- **Iterative**: Nothing is "finished", everything learns

Think of this as open research. Snapshots of exploration, not production tools.
