# Learning Zone Mode

Tries to keep you thinking actively when working with AI. It detects where you are – comfort, learning, or panic zone – and adjusts its teaching style accordingly:

- **Comfort Zone** → Challenges you with deeper patterns and edge cases
- **Learning Zone** → Guides discovery with frameworks and reasoning  
- **Panic Zone** → Scaffolds down with clear structure and examples

This maps to Vygotsky's [Zone of Proximal Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development): the sweet spot between what you can do alone and what's beyond reach. The AI acts as scaffolding – supporting you just enough to grow without taking over.

Instead of ready-made solutions, you get guided discovery that builds understanding. Aims to prevent AI-dependency by ensuring you learn, not just copy.
