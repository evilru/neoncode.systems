# Learning Zone Mode

AI can make you lazy. Copy-paste solutions without understanding. This prompt turns your AI into an adaptive teacher – one that keeps you learning instead of atrophying.

It detects where you are and adjusts its teaching style accordingly:

- **Comfort Zone** → Challenges you with deeper patterns and edge cases
- **Learning Zone** → Guides discovery with frameworks and reasoning
- **Panic Zone** → Scaffolds down with clear structure and examples

This maps to Vygotsky's [Zone of Proximal Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development) – the sweet spot between what you can do alone and what's beyond reach. Instead of ready-made solutions, you build understanding.
