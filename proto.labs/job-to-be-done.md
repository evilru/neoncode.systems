# Job To Be Done

Writing good prompts is hard. Most people don't realize how much unstated context affects the result. This prompt solves that through a guided Jobs-to-be-Done interview – it uncovers the hidden context behind what you're trying to accomplish, then generates two artifacts:

1. **Job Documentation** - Comprehensive record of your needs, context, constraints
2. **Optimized Prompt** - Tailored to your exact requirements

Inspired by how Bob Moesta interviews customers to uncover their real needs. Adaptive, thorough, practical.
