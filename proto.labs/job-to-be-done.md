# Job To Be Done

Tries to help you write better prompts through a guided JTBD interview. It uncovers the hidden context behind what you're trying to accomplish, then generates two artifacts:

1. **Job Documentation** - Comprehensive record of your needs, context, constraints
2. **Optimized Prompt** - Tailored to your exact requirements

Based on Bob Moesta's Jobs-to-be-Done methodology – adaptive, thorough, practical.
