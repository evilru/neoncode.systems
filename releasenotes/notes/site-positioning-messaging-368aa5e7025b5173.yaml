prelude: >
    Reworked site positioning and messaging across all pages. The site now
    leads with a clear standpoint instead of generic descriptions. Internal
    method naming (WSPL) has been removed from all public-facing content –
    the method speaks through the prompts, not the label.
features:
  - |
    Homepage now opens with a manifest-style tagline and three positioning
    blocks replacing the generic "What This Is / Who / Why" structure.
    Tagline: "AI amplifies what's already there. Shit in, shit out.
    That's not a tool problem."
  - |
    proto.labs now opens with a Pippi Longstocking quote and a one-line
    rationale for experimentation, establishing tone before describing
    the lab contents.
other:
  - |
    WSPL removed as a public-facing label across the website and the
    prompt.forge GitHub repository. The prompt design method is now
    referenced as "my method" with a neutral anchor link.
  - |
    Job-to-be-Done prompt page now opens with the problem statement
    ("Writing good prompts is hard...") and uses the full term
    "Jobs-to-be-Done" instead of the JTBD abbreviation.
  - |
    Learning Zone Mode prompt page now leads with the provocative opener
    "AI can make you lazy." and has been tightened for clarity.
