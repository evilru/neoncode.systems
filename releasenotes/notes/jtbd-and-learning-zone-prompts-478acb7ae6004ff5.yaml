prelude: >
    This release introduces two WSPL-based prompt templates to proto.labs,
    showcasing field-based prompt design principles in practice. Both prompts
    are production-ready and serve as reference implementations of the WSPL
    methodology, available for immediate use and experimentation. The release
    includes enhanced navigation through dynamic sidebar generation and clear
    calls-to-action for community participation.
features:
  - |
    Added Job To Be Done (JTBD) Interview Coach prompt – a meta-prompt that
    guides users through adaptive JTBD interviews to generate custom prompts.
    Produces two artifacts: comprehensive job documentation and an optimized
    prompt tailored to specific requirements. Based on Bob Moesta's JTBD
    methodology with WSPL field-based design.
  - |
    Added Learning Zone Mode prompt – an adaptive teaching assistant that
    maintains users in their optimal learning zone. Detects comfort, learning,
    and panic zones, adjusting teaching style accordingly to prevent skill
    atrophy while building understanding. Maps to Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal
    Development with constructionist learning principles.
  - |
    Implemented dynamic sidebar generation for proto.labs and prompt.forge
    sections using getSidebarItems() helper function, automatically discovering
    and displaying markdown files with proper title formatting.
  - |
    Added "Share Your Experience" and "Need Something Custom?" sections to
    prompt pages with clear calls-to-action linking to prompt.forge experiment
    and GitHub discussions.
  - |
    Enhanced proto.labs index with WSPL methodology explanation, dogfooding
    statement ("I use only WSPL prompts now"), and expectation management for
    custom prompt requests (~1 per week).
other:
  - |
    Prompts are included via VitePress @include directive from .github/prompts/
    source files, maintaining single source of truth while displaying as
    copyable code blocks.
  - |
    Updated proto.labs philosophy to position it as personal experimental
    workshop with transparent, participatory, and iterative research approach.
  - |
    Added expectation management across prompt.forge indicating selected cases
    are worked on approximately weekly basis.
